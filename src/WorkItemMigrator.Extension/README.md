# Features

This tool lets you migrate work item from Jira to Azure DevOps or Microsoft Team Foundation Server. The tool has two parts, first Jira issues are exported to files then we import the files to Azure DevOps/TFS. We believe this is a good approach to migration since it allows you to export the data to migrate and validate it before importing it. It also makes it easy to migrate in batches.

Some of the capabilities include:

- Export Jira issues from Jira queries
- Map users from Jira to users in Azure DevOps/TFS
- Migrate work item field data
- Migrate links and attachments
- Migrate history

* Download [the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/releases) and extract the files to your local workspace.
