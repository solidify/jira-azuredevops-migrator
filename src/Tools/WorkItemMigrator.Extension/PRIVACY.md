# Jira to Azure DevOps/TFS work item migration tool Privacy Policy #
At Solidify we respect your privacy and want you to feel safe with how your personal data is being processed. 

## Security of Your Information ##
We are committed to protecting the security of your information. The current implementation stores nothing about you outside of the local migration workspace used for exporting and importing data between the services. The information used during the migration (the local export files) may contain sensitive data (user id, customer information etc) and should be treated appropriately by the persons performing the migrations. 

## Data for Quality and Reliability Improvements ##
We use [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/) to collect usage and error information in order to improve the quality of the tools, the data is currently saved for 90 days.

Currently we collect the following anonymous data:

* Event data: application version, client city/country, hosting type, item count, error count, warning count, elapsed time.
* Exceptions: application errors and warnings. Note: Exception data cannot be 100% guaranteed to not leak production data.
* Dependencies: REST calls to Jira and Azure DevOps to help us understand performance issues.

## Opting out ## 
See [Telemetry](https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/blob/master/docs/telemetry.md) for details on how to disable telemetry collection.

## Collection and Use of Your Personal Information ##
We don't collect any information that identifies you as an individual, except the information Microsoft provides to us for commercial purposes from the Azure DevOps Marketplace. 

## Disclosure to Third Parties ##
Except as described in this statement, information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent. Your personal data may be disclosed when such is required according to law, such as when laws against discrimination are applicable or when such is required by the data protection agency.

If you would like to get in touch with Solidify AB in regard to your personal data, you can send an e-mail to info@solidify.se.

Effective as of July 9, 2019.
