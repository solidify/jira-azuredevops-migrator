# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. Convert Jira formatted descriptions and comments on migration

- As of release 2.3.1 we have introduced a new mapper called "MapRendered" that should be used when mapping fields to get the Html rendered value from Jira.

Example:

```json
{
    "source": "description",
    "target": "Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps",
    "mapper":"MapRendered"
}
```

## 2. Why I am getting Unauthorized exception when running the export?

### General advice

- Ensure that your Jira credentials and Jira URL are correct.
- Ensure that your `jira-export` command and all the flags are correct. See: <https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/blob/master/docs/jira-export.md>
- Try different combinations of your jira user/api credentials. The functionality here could depend on wether you are using Jira Cloud or Jira Server, as well as wether you have set your user's email as public in the user profile in Jira Cloud, and jira might not be accepting certain credentials. Try all combinations of the following:
  - username: **email**
  - username: **Jira Username**
  - username: **accountId** (navigate to your user profile and find the accountId in the URL, for example: <https://solidifydemo.atlassian.net/jira/people/>**6038bfcc25b84ea0696240d4**
  - password: **user password** (same as login)
  - password: **API token**

### Issues with escape sequences in credentials

Another problem could be that you have characters in your `--password` parameter that is reserved by the terminal, e.g. **dollar sign** ($) in Powershell. A potential solution sometimes is to escape any dollar sign characters. So make sure that your `--password` parameter is properly escaped, depending on what terminal you are using. Example for Powershell: `$` becomes `$. Otherwise you can always try a different terminal like CMD or bash.

### Issues with Captcha

For some instances of Jira Server and some security configurations, the user can become silently locked out of Jira after repeated failed attempts to use the API Token.

The solution is usually to navigate to your Jira project in a web browser, log out and log in again. If you are presented with a CAPTCHA, go ahead and solve the CAPTCHA and log in. You should now be able to authenticate to the Rest API again.

If you regularly face this problem, we would recommend authenticating with **username and password** instead of the API Token.

### Issues with user permissions

If you are still not able to authenticate. Try and run the tool as another user. Also make sure to try as a user with admin privileges in your Jira organization.

## 3. How to map custom field?

- To map a custom field by value we have to add a mapping in the configuration file, using the custom field name:

```json
    {
        "source": "Custom Field Name Jira",
        "source-type": "name",
        "target": "Custom.TargetField"
    },
```

- Alternatively, we can map the field key instead of the name. Inspect the REST API response to find the **field key** for your custom field. This is usually something like **customfield_12345**.

Example:

```json
{
    "source": "customfield_12345",
    "target": "Custom.TargetField"
}
```

### (Troubleshooting) My custom field is not migrated correctly/not migrated at all

If your custom field is not imported correctly into Azure DevOps, please go through the following checklist and ensure that every step has been followed:

1. Ensure that the field is created in the correct Azure DevOps process model, and that the field is existing on the correct work item type.
2. Ensure that the `target` of your field mapping is set to the **Field reference name** of the ADO field, not the **Field name** (Observe that these two are different!!!)

    For example, if the **field name** is `MyField`, the **field reference name** is usually something like `Custom.MyField` (for ADO Services) or `MyCompany.MyField` (for ADO Server). Spaces are not allowed in the **field reference name**.

    Here is a reference sheet with all of the default fields: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field?view=azure-devops> (click each field to open up the documentation page and view the field reference name).

### (Troubleshooting) I receive errors like: **VS403691: Update to work item 165 had two or more updates for field with reference name 'Custom.XXX'. A field cannot be updated more than once in the same update."**

This error is usually indicative of incorrect configuration on the user's side. Please follow the checklist [here](https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/blob/master/docs/faq.md#troubleshooting-my-custom-field-is-not-migrated-correctlynot-migrated-at-all) (the section above this one, in the same document) to ensure that you do not have any issues with your `config.json` file.

## 4. (In depth) How does Link Mapping work?

The Jira Azure DevOps Migration Tool uses the **link-map** property in the `config.json` file to map link types between Jira and Azure DevOps (ADO). 

The `link-map` property in your `config.json` file should look like this:

```json
"link-map": {
  "link": [
    {
      "source": "Epic",
      "target": "System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Reverse"
    },
    {
      "source": "Parent",
      "target": "System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Reverse"
    },
    {
      "source": "Child",
      "target": "System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Forward"
    },
    {
      "source": "Relates",
      "target": "System.LinkTypes.Related"
    },
    {
      "source": "Cloners",
      "target": "System.LinkTypes.Related"
    },
    {
      "source": "Duplicate",
      "target": "System.LinkTypes.Duplicate-Forward"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **How to Configure Link Mapping**

1. **Identify Jira Link Types:**
   - Go to **Settings > Jira Settings > Issues > Issue Types > Issue Types** in Jira Cloud.
   - Locate the **Name**, **Outward Description**, and **Inward Description** for each link type.

2. **Map Jira Link Types to ADO:**
   - The **source** property in the mapping should match the **Name** of the link type in Jira.
   - The **target** property should be the corresponding ADO link type.

#### **Example: Standard Jira Link Types**

| Name     | Outward Description | Inward Description |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Blocks  | blocks              | is blocked by        |
| Cloners | clones              | is cloned by         |
| Defect  | created             | created by           |
| Duplicate | duplicates        | is duplicated by     |
| Related | relates to          | relates to           |
| Relates | relates to          | relates to           |
| Test    | tests               | is tested by         |

---

### **Direction Handling**

The tool automatically considers the direction of links. By default, links are assumed to be **outward**. If the link's description matches the **inward description** from Jira, the tool automatically **reverses the direction**:

- **Forward:** Represents downward or child relationships (e.g., `Hierarchy-Forward`).
- **Reverse:** Represents upward or parent relationships (e.g., `Hierarchy-Reverse`).

#### **Example:**
- If the **inwardDescription** of a link is "is blocked by" (from the "Blocks" link type), the tool will map it as `System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Reverse`.
- Conversely, if the **outwardDescription** is "blocks", it will map as `System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Forward`.

The tool retrieves the outward and inward descriptions from Jira's project metadata API. In directional or hierarchical link types, **"-Forward"** indicates a downward or child relationship, while **"Reverse-"** indicates an upward or parent relationship. The tool will adjust the link direction accordingly if the description matches the inward description of a given link type.


## 5. I need to obtain a field reference name/link type in Azure DevOps

Here is a reference sheet with all of the default fields in Azure DevOps: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field?view=azure-devops> (click each field to open up the documentation page and view the field reference name).

Here is a reference sheet with all of the default link types in Azure DevOps: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/link-type-reference?view=azure-devops>.

## 6. Guideline for migrating multiple projects

### Scenario 1: Single project

When migrating a single project, you may have issues with links to other issues that are in other projects or otherwise not captured by the JQL query.

You can include such linked issues (all parents, epic links and sub items) by setting the following property in the configuration file:

```json
  "download-options": 7
```

See <https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/blob/master/docs/config.md#download-options> for more information on the `download-options` property.

### Scenario 2: Multiple projects

When migrating multiple project, one after another (or otherwise running several migrations with different queries in a serial fashion), you may get duplicate issues if you set *download-options* to anything other than 0.

The recommendation is thus to turn off all linked issues (parents, epic links and sub items) by setting the following property in the configuration file:

```json
  "download-options": 0
```

See <https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/blob/master/docs/config.md#download-options> for more information on the `download-options` property.

When running multiple migrations, one after another, we recommend following the below guidelines:

- Use one separate **config file** and one separate `workspace` folder per migration.
- For every completed migration, locate the `itemsJournal.txt` file inside your `workspace` folder. Copy this file to the workspace folder of the next migration. Then proceed with the next migration. This will ensure that you do not get duplicates, and any cross-project or cross-query links will be intact.
- When running the **wi-import**, do not use the `--force` flag (**Important!**)

#### Example, run schedule for migrating multiple projects

For example, let us say you are migrating the Jira projects A, B and C in sequence, to the target ADO projects A1, B1 and C2. The schedule would then look something like below:

1. Export project A into **workspaceA**
2. Import project A1
3. Copy `itemsJournal.txt` from **workspaceA** to **workspaceB**
4. Export project B into **workspaceB**
5. Import project B1
6. Copy `itemsJournal.txt` from **workspaceB** to **workspaceC**
7. Export project C into **workspaceC**
8. Import project C1

## 7. What is the purpose of the --force flag?

Here you will find a description on what the `--force` flag does under various circumstances.

|                    | with --force                      | without --force                   | read more                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Jira Exporter      | Items in the migration workspace (local) will be overwritten. | Items already downloaded in the workspace will be skipped. Items in the workspace will remain intact. | [jira-export.md](https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/blob/master/docs/jira-export.md) |
| Work Item Importer | Work Items in ADO will remain intact. New duplicate work items may be created. | Revisions which already have been imported will be skipped. Existing Work Items may be updated with new data if the incoming revisions have not already been imported. | [wi-import.md](https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/blob/master/docs/wi-import.md)|

## 8. How to migrate custom fields having dropdown lists?

- To map a custom field which is an dropdown list you can use MapArray mapper to get in a better way.
Also take a look at the other possible [Mappers](config.md#mappers) to use.

Example:

```json
{
    "source": "UserPicker",
    "source-type": "name",
    "target": "Custom.TextField",
    "for": "Product Backlog Item",
    "mapper": "MapArray"
}
```

## 9. How to migrate correct user from Jira to Azure DevOps and assign to the new work items?

- User mapping differs between Jira Cloud and Jira Server. To migrate users and assign the new work items in Azure DevOps to the same user as the original task had in Jira, we need to add a text file in the root that would look something like this:

    ```txt
    Jira.User1@some.domain=AzureDevOps.User1@some.domain
    Jira.User2@some.domain=AzureDevOps.User2@some.domain
    Jira.User3@some.domain=AzureDevOps.User3@some.domain
    ```

- When using Jira Cloud then firstly make sure in the config the '"using-jira-cloud": true' is set. The user mapping file should have accountId/email value pairs. To use email value pairs the users email should be set to public in the user profile in Jira Cloud, otherwise the tool cant get the email and will use accountId instead for mapping.

- It can happen that the **JiraExporter** cannot find you users' email addresses. This will happen if e.g. your user has chosen not to make their email address public. You will then receive the following warning when running the **jira-export.exe**:

    ```txt
    [W][01:57:30] Email is not public for user '630ddc7d316bbc88c1234e3b' in Jira, using usernameOrAccountId '630ddc7d316bbc88c1234e3b' for mapping.
    ```

    If you receive such a warning, you will need to map the users' IDs instead, just like you would with the emails. You will need to include the following line in your `users.txt`:

    ```txt
    630ddc7d316bbc88c1234e3b=AzureDevOps.User@some.domain
    ```

    The correct format of the `users.txt`-file would then be:

    ```txt
    JiraAccountId1=AzureDevOps.User1@some.domain
    JiraAccountId2=AzureDevOps.User2@some.domain
    JiraAccountId3=AzureDevOps.User3@some.domain
    ```

    In order to make sure that your user's email is publicly visible to everyone in Jira, go to <https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/profile-and-visibility> -> Contact -> Email Address -> Who can see this? -> "Anyone"

- When using Jira Server then firstly make sure in the config the ' "using-jira-cloud": false' is set. The mapping should look like the example below:

    ```txt
    Jira.User1@some.domain=AzureDevOps.User1@some.domain
    Jira.User2@some.domain=AzureDevOps.User2@some.domain
    Jira.User3@some.domain=AzureDevOps.User3@some.domain
    ```

## 10. How to migrate the Work Log (Time Spent, Remaining Estimate fields)?

You can migrate the logged and remaining time using the following field mappings.

The history of the **logged time** and **remaining time** will be preserved on each revision, and thus the history of these fields will be migrated just like any other field.

```json
{
  "source": "timespent$Rendered",
  "target": "Custom.TimeSpentSecondsRendered"
},
{
  "source": "timespent",
  "target": "Custom.TimeSpentSeconds"
},
{
  "source": "timeestimate$Rendered",
  "target": "Custom.RemainingEstimateSecondsRendered"
},
{
  "source": "timeestimate",
  "target": "Custom.RemainingEstimateSeconds"
}
```

## 11. How to map custom user picker fields

Here is how we have successfully mapped user picker fields in the past. `source` should be the field name:

```json
{
    "source": "User picker Field Name Jira",
    "target": "Custom.CustomUserPicker",
    "source-type": "name",
    "mapper": "MapUser"
},
```

## 12. How to map datetime fields

Here is how we can map datetime fields like ResolvedDate:

```json
{
  "source": "resolutiondate",
  "type": "datetime",
  "target": "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ResolvedDate"
}
```

## 13. How to migrate an issue fields to a comment

Through some manual intervention, we can migrate every historical value of an **issue field** to a **Work Item Comments**. Simply do the following:

1. Map each of the desired fields to a unique token, e.g.:

    ```json
    {
      "source": "customfield_10112",
      "target": "5397700c-5bc3-4efe-b1e9-d626929b89ca"
    },
    {
      "source": "customfield_10111",
      "target": "e0cd3eb0-d8b7-4e62-ba35-c24d06d7f667"
    },
    ```

1. Run `JiraExport` as usual.
1. Open up the `workspace` folder in an IDE like Visual Studio Code and do a search-replace across all contents in the whole `workspace` folder:
1. Replace each unique token with `System.History`:
   - `5397700c-5bc3-4efe-b1e9-d626929b89ca` > `System.History`
   - `e0cd3eb0-d8b7-4e62-ba35-c24d06d7f667` > `System.History`
1. Run `WiImport` as usual.

## 14. How to omit the Jira issue ID/key in the work item title

By default, the field mapping for `System.Title` will be set up so that the title is prefixed with the Issue key. This can be prevented by omitting the **MapTitle mapper** from the field map in the configuration:

```json
  {
    "source": "summary",
    "target": "System.Title"
  }
```

Instead of the default:

```json
  {
    "source": "summary",
    "target": "System.Title",
    "mapper": "MapTitle"
  }
```

## 15. What are the base-area-path and base-iteration-path properties in the config.json file?

**`base-area-path`:**  
The `base-area-path` property in the migrator configuration specifies the root area path under which all migrated work items will be placed. This path organizes work items into different functional or project areas within Azure DevOps.

**`base-iteration-path`:**  
The `base-iteration-path` property defines the root iteration path for the migrated work items. This path is used to organize work items according to different iterations or sprints.

### How to determine the correct values:

- **`base-area-path`:** Navigate to your Azure DevOps project and go to **Project Settings** > **Project Configuration** > **Areas**. Identify the root area path you want to use for your migrated work items.
- **`base-iteration-path`:** Similarly, navigate to **Project Settings** > **Project Configuration** > **Iterations**. Identify the root iteration path you want to use.

### What if my Jira project structure does not directly map to the Azure DevOps structure?

In such cases, you may need to create a mapping strategy to translate Jira project components to Azure DevOps area and iteration paths. This might involve some manual configuration and planning to ensure that the migrated work items fit into the desired structure. See the next section in this FAQ for a guide on how to map sprints, iteration paths and area paths.

## 16. How to map sprints, iteration paths and area paths

It is possible to do custom mappings of the **Jira Sprints** as **Iteration Paths**, and vice versa for **Area Paths**.

### Default method: using the MapSprint mapper

The mapSprint mapper is included with all of our sample config files, and does a pretty good job mapping the sprints one-to-one:

```json
      {
        "source": "customfield_10010",
        "target": "System.IterationPath",
        "mapper": "MapSprint"
      }
```

### Using a key-value mapper

If you want more granular control over how your sprints and area paths are mapped, you can use a **key-value** mapper.

Here is an example of how to map sprints in this way:

```json
{
  "source": "customfield_10010",
  "target": "System.IterationPath",
  "mapping": {
    "values": [
      {
        "source": "sprint1",
        "target": "Area1"
      },
      {
        "source": "sprint2",
        "target": "MyFolder1/Area2"
      },
      {
        "source": "sprint3",
        "target": "MyFolder1/MyFolder2/Area3"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In addition, you will need to set the **base-iteration-path** and **base-area-path** properties in your configuration:

```json
{
  "base-iteration-path": "Migrated",
  "base-area-path": "Migrated",
}
```

This will set the Iteration path correctly. The final path will be like the following pattern:

- `<project name>\<base-iteration-path>\<mapped value>`
- `<project name>\<base-area-path>\<mapped value>`

## 17. How to migrate Development Links (commit, PR, branch)

If you have previously migrated your BitBucket git repositories to your Azure DevOps Server/organization, you can also migrate the development links of the Jira Issues to the corresponding ADO Work Items.

Only **Commit** links are supported as of today (2024-04-12), and no other development link types.

In your configuration file, you must specify the following properties:

```json
  "include-development-links": true,
  "repository-map": {
    "repository": [
      {
        "source": "repo-name-in-bitbucket",
        "target": "repo-name-in-ado"
      }
    ]
  },
```

The **repository-map** must contain a key-value lookup table with the names of the Bitbucket git repositories and their translations in ADO.

## 18. How to limit the number of issues to be exported during JIRA export (pagination)

If you export or the whole migration takes too long, you can achieve something similar to pagination by limiting the export to batches of issues through the `query` property of your `config.json` file. Simply enter a JQL query that filters issues on the `ìd` property, for example:

```txt
project = "PROJECTKEY" AND id >= 10000 AND id < 11000
project = "PROJECTKEY" AND id >= 11000 AND id < 12000
project = "PROJECTKEY" AND id >= 12000 AND id < 13000
```

And so on.

You can always use the **issues** view in your Jira project to experiment with different JQL queries.

## 19. I get https response code 400 and a System.Aggregate Exception with the warning "Failed to get item count using query ...", and no items are exported

The issue is usually a malformed query. Make sure that you have tried all of the following solutions:

- Ensure that the `query` property in your `config.json` file follows correct [JQL syntax](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/jql/overview)
  - You can set up the corresponding JQL query in the issues view in your Jira project to debug the query.
- Ensure that you don't have any issues with [authorization](https://github.com/solidify/jira-azuredevops-migrator/blob/master/docs/faq.md#2-why-i-am-getting-unauthorized-exception-when-running-the-export).
- In the `project` clause of your query, try both the project name, project key and project ID

If all of the above suggestions fail, verify that you are able to reach the issue search rest API endpoint outside of the Exporter. Try to see if you can set up a Rest query in [postman](https://www.postman.com/) or similar, with the same JQL query as you are trying in your config.json-file, with the same user + API token/password and let me know the result of that.

Here is an example in curl:

```txt
curl -D- 
  -u johnie:johnie 
  -X POST 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  --data '{"jql":"project = QA","startAt":0,"maxResults":2,"fields":["id","key"]}' 

 "http://johnie:8081/rest/api/2/search"
```

## 20. I get the warning message "VS402625: Dates must be increasing with each revision."

This warning message will show up if the tool attempts to import a subsequent revision with a changedDate that is less than the current changedDate of the current state of the Work Item.

This can have multiple causes:

- Two consecutive revisions have the same date stamp, or the difference is 1ms or less (i.e. the issue is in the Jira issue data itself).
- ADO can sometimes add a few milliseconds to the work item changedDate when adding an attachment.
- A link change in Jira has created a situation where the Link Import happens earlier in time than the timestamp of one of the revisions in the associated issues.

You may end up receiving an error message similar to this one:

```txt
[W][11:15:29] Received response while updating Work Item: VS402625: Dates must be increasing with each revision.. Bumped Changed Date by 2ms and trying again... New ChangedDate: 3/31/2016 3:21:38 PM, ms: 172
```

The tool is attempting to buffer the subsequent revision's changedDate by a few miliseconds in order to get around the error response from the ADO Rest API. The exact number of miliseconds to buffer can be controlled with the config parameter `changeddate-bump-ms` (default: 2). If you experience a lot of this warning message and believe that your import is slowing down because of it, go ahead and add this parameter to your `config.json` file and try increasing the value by 1 (3, 4, 5, and so on...) until the import succeeds without too many warnings.

Example `config.json`:

```json
  "changeddate-bump-ms": 5,
```

## 21. Sprint names are corrupted. ADO Iteration paths are named "[ synced = false  ]"

The issue is usually that a custom field has been defined in Jira which is also named "Sprint", and the tool is picking up this field instead of the default Srpint field.

Based on this forum post, you could possibly try to map the reserved customfield ID for the Sprint field: <https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/confirm-variancy-of-jira-cloud-issue-field-keys-for-custom-fields/21134>

Use the above forum post to determine the custom field ID for Sprint in your organization, then try the following field mapping:

```json
      {
        "source": "customfield_10016",
        "target": "System.IterationPath",
        "mapper": "MapSprint"
      },
```

It could be worth trying this mapping when running against Jira Cloud too:

```json
      {
        "source": "customfield_10010",
        "target": "System.IterationPath",
        "mapper": "MapSprint"
      },
```

It seems that for jira server, the field IDs can different between different developer instances. You can use the Get Fields endpoint to find out which field ID (customfield_xxxxx) is used by Sprint in your instance: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/#about

## 22. Azure DevOps Rate and usage limits (ADO Cloud only)

In the unlikely event that you experience issues with being rate limited by Azure DevOps, we always recommend the following procedure:

### Check usage statistics

In order to rule out wether you are actually dealing with a rate limiting issue or not, navigate to your **DevOps Organization** and go to **Organization Settings** > **Usage**. Here, filter out the queries for the user who is running the migration, and ensure that there have been no queries that have been **Delayed** or **Blocked**. If all queries have Status=**Normal**, then you are not hitting the rate limit.

### Basic + Test Plans, additional usage limits

You can get additional rate and usage limits by assigning the Basic + Test Plans access level to the desired identities used by your application. Once the need for higher rate limits are fulfilled, you can go back to the access level that the identity used to have. You're charged for the cost of Basic + Test Plans access level only for the time it's assigned to the identity (Source: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/rate-limits?view=azure-devops>).
